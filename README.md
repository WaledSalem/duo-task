# Duo Task
Clone down this repository and write the Dockerfile for the Flask application to containerise it.

Then, create a docker-compose.yaml file to deploy the Flask application and an NGINX container with a reverse proxy configuration, which will require you to bind mount the nginx.conf file to the container.

Make sure you can access the application via your machine's IP address on port 80.
