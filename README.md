You will have to write a Dockerfile to build the image - a Dockerfile template has been provided for you.
Create a network and connect the Flask app container and an NGINX container to it
Remember to bind mount the nginx.conf file as shown in the tutorial above
Navigate to your application either through your browser or on the command line with curl localhost.
